## Final Work Review

**"Always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it."**  This action was applied to HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. To create a real-world front-end application from scratch, we have used Jon Ducket's JAVASCRIPT & JQuery book, references for our style.css on Google, W3Schools, CSSPortal, Snyk and all ZOOM recordings (of previous classes). Looks much cleaner, organised and easier to find what you are looking for. Comments were added in JAVASCRIPT to show what was done and for what purpose.

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
